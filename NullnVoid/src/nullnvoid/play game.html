			Rules
		</header>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Each level will present you with a list of words surrounded by characters,
			    your job is to find out which word hacks the terminal and moves you into the next level.</li>
			<li>With the selection of each word inside the level, you will be presented with a 
			    probability of that word being correct. Use these to help you select the correct word.</li>
			<li>You will lose the game once you have run out of guesses on your current level, so be smart!</li>
			<li>Finally, as you progress through higher levels. The words will become longer, which makes 
			    it harder for you to guess. Good luck!</li>
