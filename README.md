  The Requirements for the 1st Midterm Project Presentations and Reports are: 
    For Presentations:
They should be at the maximum 7 min long
Every team member must present material during the presentation. When it is your turn to present, please introduce yourself, and speak clearly and loudly so the whole class can hear you. Do NOT pick too complicated goals that need more than the time budget you have to finish (accurately evaluating the scale of tasks is an important skill.)
Every item listed under the presentation requirements must be on the slides, and in the order requested. Check on part 2) of the attached requirement file for details. 
As the instructor emphasized when meeting with team leaders on Feb 13, each team needs to demonstrate at least one project feature during the presentation, again please check on part 2) of the attached requirement file for details.
For Reports:
Every item listed under the report requirements must be included in the report, and in the same order as requested. Check on part 3) of the attached requirement file for details.
Make sure any images included in the report be given enough clarity/resolution, and all texts be written in large enough font, to facilitate the reading of them.
The report must be professional. For example the style and format of the contents should be consistent.
The report file can be in either a Microsoft Word file or a PDF file.
Note - as compared with those requirements listed for the initial presentations and reports, the requirements given here for the 1st mid-term are more specific and refined and all of them need to be clearly addressed.

  What we went over (Friday, 2/22/2019)
If you have any references that you used while writing or used their code, add it to the references.txt on github
We are putting together our presentation for this upcoming wednesday, along with the report that i'll submit
Remember to fill out peer review sheets on moodle, there a link in the discord
On our presentation, we will demonstrate the front end that we have done and the string comparison (we'll have to go over it so everyone understands the use of it)
We just wanted updates on the code that has been done, i've got my front end up with v1.1 on github. Anything else that you guys have gotten done, just feel free to put it on github. We can combine it later on.
